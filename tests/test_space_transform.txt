The search space transformations implemented in this repository are taken from LlamaTune. 
For reference, see the LlamaTune paper(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05128) or code(https://github.com/uw-mad-dash/llamatune) 
The primary advantages of these transformations is that they reduce optimization time both in terms of number of iterations as well as reducing clock time used per iteration.
Further experiments must be conducted to gather conclusive evidence that the transformations cause a reduction in number of iterations.
But a reduction in the amount of clock time Cybernetics uses to run an ML optimizer has been observed.
Optimization time was reduced from 125s to 73s for 100 iterations. Results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VRq3uvkJ8ZYDsqi6IG288k8uUsWoadYSekjJx3CbEnI/edit#gid=0
